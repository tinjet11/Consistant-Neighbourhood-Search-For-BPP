# 1D Bin Packing Algorithm with Consistent Neighborhood Search

## Overview

This project implements an algorithm to solve the 1D Bin Packing problem using Consistent Neighborhood Search. The 1D Bin Packing problem involves packing a set of items with different sizes into a finite number of bins, each with a fixed capacity, in such a way that the number of bins used is minimized.

## Features

- Efficient implementation of the Consistent Neighborhood Search algorithm.
- Incorporates Tabu Search, First Fit Decreasing, and Hill Climbing strategies.
- Detailed output showing the number of bins used and the distribution of items in each bin.
